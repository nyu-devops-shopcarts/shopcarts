Resource: /shopcarts

## Description:

The shopcarts resource allow customers to make a collection of products that they want to
purchase. It should contain a reference to a product and the quantity the customer wants to buy.
Check with the Customer team and Product team for the format of their ids. It may also contain
the price of the product at the time they placed it in the cart. A customer will only have one
shopcart. Since this is really a collection of product items, you will need to implement a
subordinate API to place items into the shopcarts collection (e.g., /shopcarts/{id}/items).
You also will need to associate the shopcart with a customer preferably through their customer
id.

Project will be complete on May 20 2020
